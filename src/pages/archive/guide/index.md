## Where to Place the Post Files



Your post files should be placed in `src/content/posts/` directory. You can also create sub-directories to better organize your posts and assets.

```
src/content/posts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ algorithmic-ghosts.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-interview/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
```
