# About
I’m a creative technologist with a passion for tech policy and Responsible AI. I love exploring how laws can shape the future of technology, especially in ways that protect both people and the planet. When I’m not diving into policy research, you’ll find me practicing yoga, traveling to new places, or hanging out with animals (big fan of dogs!). I’m always looking for ways to combine my love for creativity, tech, and making the world a little better.
