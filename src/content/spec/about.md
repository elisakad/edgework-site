# About me!
I’m a creative technologist with a passion for tech policy and Responsible AI. I love exploring how laws can shape the future of technology, especially in ways that protect both people and the planet. When I’m not diving into policy research, you’ll find me practicing yoga, traveling to new places, or hanging out with animals (big fan of dogs!). I’m always looking for ways to combine my love for creativity, tech, and making the world a little better.

# Why Edgework?
Edgework is a term borrowed from sociology—originally coined by Stephen Lyng—to describe the skillful navigation of boundaries between order and chaos, risk and control, structure and spontaneity. It captures the spirit of this project, which lives at the intersection of technology, law, and lived experience, probing the blurry edges of AI systems, policy design, and human responsibility. 

But Edgework also describes how I move through the world: I’m drawn to thresholds—between disciplines, identities, and institutions—and I thrive in spaces where complexity, ambiguity, and experimentation are not just tolerated, but necessary. This portfolio is both a research endeavor and a personal ethos: a space for navigating uncertainty, documenting insight, and making meaning at the margins.
