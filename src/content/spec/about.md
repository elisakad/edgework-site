# About me!
I’m a creative technologist with a passion for tech policy and Responsible AI. I love exploring how laws can shape the future of technology, especially in ways that protect both people and the planet. When I’m not diving into policy research, you’ll find me practicing yoga, traveling to new places, or hanging out with animals (big fan of dogs!). I’m always looking for ways to combine my love for creativity, tech, and making the world a little better.

# Why Edgework?
Edgework is a sociological concept coined by Stephen Lyng to describe the practice of navigating the boundary between order and chaos—where risk, uncertainty, and agency collide. It often refers to moments when individuals operate at the limits of control, structure, and safety, whether physically, psychologically, or socially.

The term has been used to analyze various contexts, including extreme sports, thrill-seeking behaviors, and even the challenges of living in a rapidly changing world. In the context of this project, Edgework serves as a metaphor for the complex interplay between technology, policy, and society, where individuals and communities navigate the uncertainties and risks associated with AI systems.
