# Reverberations in the Digital Cathedral: An Autoethnographic Reflection on Content Governance

When I think about my role in the content governance world, I find myself grappling with metaphors that could visualize my experiences. These experiences are multifaceted: an amalgam of the resilience and analytical power behind the responsibility of guarding the online world.

Recently, I stumbled across the verb "reverberate" when describing the sensory overwhelm that accompanies this work. And this inspired a series of visuals to describe the experiences of working in online content policy, characterized by its sacred nature as a community relic. This work is housed in a metaphorical digital cathedral—one that takes you through the human experience and requires the same value and reverence to navigate.

Every online utterance reverberates against the ancient stones holding together this sacred space, amplifying until they fill the vast expanse. In this world of content governance, the digital space becomes a sacred space—a cathedral with hallowed halls and the echoes of countless voices.

The sacredness of this digital cathedral is rooted in its nature as a community relic. In this space, the work of content policy and governance is invisible. Its impact is perhaps known but rarely discussed. Like a cathedral’s solemn marble walls, its sculpted prophets in the shadows and dignified mosaic windows—many hands make up the digital labor sustaining online safety in this AI-driven world. The cathedral is a paradoxical sanctuary—one that offers no safety, as the very nature of the content that passes through its halls denies the peace one might seek in a holy place.

That digital labor is no ordinary work. The content that a mere computer screen divides
