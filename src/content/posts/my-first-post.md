As AI systems continue to expand across global markets, the need for robust, ethical governance is more pressing than ever. This comparative analysis delves into how three influential jurisdictions—the European Union, the United States, and France—are approaching AI compliance, examining their regulatory philosophies and enforcement mechanisms.

In the European Union, the AI Act represents one of the most comprehensive efforts to regulate AI, focusing on risk-based frameworks that classify AI systems into categories based on their potential harm. The EU's proactive stance not only emphasizes transparency and accountability but also advocates for human rights, data protection, and social responsibility. This contrasts sharply with the U.S. sectoral approach, where AI regulations are fragmented across industries, offering a more decentralized and market-driven model. While the U.S. approach prioritizes innovation, it risks leaving gaps in accountability and ethics, particularly in sensitive areas like facial recognition and automated decision-making.

France, through its Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), takes a unique approach by blending EU regulations with a strong focus on individual rights and data privacy. The CNIL’s guidelines provide a framework for ethical AI development, focusing on ensuring that AI systems are not only legally compliant but also aligned with democratic values and human dignity.

This paper will explore the implications of these regulatory frameworks for AI development, particularly with regard to marginalized workers such as content moderators and data annotators. These workers, often invisible in the AI ecosystem, are tasked with ensuring the accuracy and fairness of AI systems—yet, they remain vulnerable to exploitation without sufficient regulatory protections. By comparing the strengths and weaknesses of these regulatory models, this analysis aims to offer insights into how global AI safety laws can evolve to better protect both the technology and the workers who make it possible.
