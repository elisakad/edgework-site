As artificial intelligence technologies continue to permeate global society, it is crucial to consider how different cultures, societies, and economies define and approach AI risk. The current landscape of AI risk frameworks is overwhelmingly shaped by Western ideologies, particularly from the Global North, with a predominant focus on the needs, values, and concerns of wealthy, industrialized nations. However, this approach risks overlooking the diverse realities of Global South nations and marginalized communities, who may experience the risks and consequences of AI in ways that are distinct and disproportionate.

This paper will take a postcolonial perspective on AI risk taxonomies, exploring how Global South nations—and by extension, marginalized communities within Europe—define and respond to AI risks. Drawing on examples from regions with varying levels of technological infrastructure, economic development, and social inequality, we will explore how these communities might prioritize risks that are often sidelined in Western frameworks, such as data sovereignty, cultural bias, economic exploitation, and AI-driven inequality.

For instance, in many parts of the Global South, data colonialism—the extraction and exploitation of data from developing nations—has become a critical issue. These nations often lack the regulatory capacity to protect their data or assert control over how their citizens' data is used by multinational AI companies. Additionally, the imposition of Western-centric AI models can undermine local values, traditional knowledge systems, and cultural norms, leading to AI systems that are misaligned with the needs and priorities of local populations.

By examining the historical and ongoing power dynamics at play in AI development and deployment, this paper will argue for the creation of more inclusive AI risk frameworks—ones that do not default to Western assumptions or prioritize the interests of the Global North. These frameworks should engage with local stakeholders, incorporate regional knowledge, and prioritize justice, equity, and sustainability. By shifting away from a one-size-fits-all approach, we can begin to create AI systems that are truly global in scope, while respecting and uplifting the voices and concerns of those most impacted by AI technologies.
