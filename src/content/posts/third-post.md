As AI systems scale across industries and borders, there is a growing blind spot in global policy: the wellbeing of human workers who quietly power these technologies behind the scenes. Among the most affected are content moderators, data annotators, and other “ghost workers” whose labor is essential to the functionality and safety of AI platforms, yet whose rights and health are often ignored in both public debate and regulatory frameworks.

This piece will focus on content moderators—workers who review and remove harmful material from social platforms and AI training data—to illustrate how AI governance has structurally neglected safety-critical human roles. Despite being essential to trust and safety operations, moderators often face traumatic exposure, precarious employment, low pay, and limited psychological support, particularly in outsourced or subcontracted environments in the Global South.

Currently, there is no cohesive policy framework—in the U.S., EU, or globally—that centers the labor conditions, mental health, or long-term protections of these workers. While AI safety and algorithmic transparency are increasingly regulated, the human safety net within AI ecosystems remains thin.

This paper will:

Map existing labor protections and gaps across jurisdictions (e.g. EU labor directives, U.S. gig economy law, outsourced worker protections in India or Kenya);

Explore why content moderators remain excluded from “AI stakeholder” status in global regulation and ethics discourse;

Propose a policy framework for “ethical employment” across the AI value chain—integrating labor law, occupational health, data transparency, and human rights principles;

Highlight how a Responsible AI agenda must include socioeconomic justice and institutional accountability, not just algorithmic fairness.

Ultimately, this project calls for a reimagining of AI policy—one that acknowledges and protects the invisible architects of the digital world.
