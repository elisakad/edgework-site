# A digital research journal exploring the legal, ethical, and human dimensions of AI governance.


This is a living research journal, digital portfolio, and creative lab exploring the human consequences of AI systems and the legal, ethical, and policy frameworks we need to govern them. This space is rooted in both professional experience and critical inquiryâ€”drawing from my firsthand work in responsible AI, digital governance, and the social impact of emerging technologies. 

Through a diverse collection of essays, case studies, expert interviews, and policy reflections, I explore how AI systems shape human lives, how regulation lags behind innovation, and how we might imagine more just and accountable frameworks for the future.
