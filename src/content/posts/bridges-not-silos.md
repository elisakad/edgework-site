In many AI spaces, engineers and policymakers operate in parallel—but not in partnership. Technical teams focus on optimization and deployment, while policy stakeholders shape regulation and governance from the outside in. I believe we need more intentional dialogue between these worlds—not just to align compliance, but to **co-create systems** that reflect both technical feasibility and democratic values.

What if instead of working in silos, we embedded policy translators, sociotechnical liaisons, or Responsible AI PMs directly into the development lifecycle? These roles can help translate complex regulatory principles into usable technical constraints and open up space for participatory design.

This idea builds on inspiration from Microsoft’s [Responsible AI Standard](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai), the [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework), and hybrid teams like those fostered by the [AI Now Institute](https://ainowinstitute.org/). If we want to build AI that reflects public values, we need more people who can speak *both* languages: engineering and ethics, compliance and code.

> AI alignment doesn’t happen after the fact. It begins with who’s at the table.
