# 🌐 Edgework – A Digital Field Notebook by Elisa

A creative, research-driven portfolio built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) 🚀. This site is the public-facing home of **Edgework**, my self-designed project exploring the the nexus of technology, policy, and human experience- rooted in my deep curiosity for how people shape and are shaped by digital systems.

## 🧠 About Edgework
> “Edgework” is a sociological term that refers to working at the boundary—of disciplines, of systems, of stories.

- Short essays and research briefs  
- Interviews with experts in tech and policy
